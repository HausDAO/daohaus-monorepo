# DAOhaus Connect

Package name: `daohaus-connect`

**DAOhaus Connect** is our first feature library. Our feature libraries are a step beyond our component library, and either include additional functionality or leverage the DAO Data SDK to create "smart components." DAOhaus Connect provides a drop-in component for handling wallet connection, and includes additional functionality such as notifying users of unsupported networks, switching networks, and displaying basic [Ceramic profile](https://ceramic.network/) data if the user has one set.

This is used throughout our applications and is designed to be leveraged by the larger DAOhaus community as a portal into the DAOhaus ecosystem.

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).
